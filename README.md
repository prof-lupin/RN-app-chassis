## Making it Work

Make sure that the proper development environment and simulators are set up on your machine by following the instructions [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

1. Change directory to the project root in the terminal.

2. In the terminal, run `npx react-native start` to start the metro bundler.

3. Open another terminal window. Match Step 1 and run `npx react-native run-ios //for ios` or `npx react-native run-android //for android`
